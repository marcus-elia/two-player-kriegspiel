# two-player-kriegspiel
Kriegspiel is a variation of chess where you cannot see your opponent's pieces. In real life, this requires you and your opponent to be in two different rooms with two chessboards, and to have a moderator with a master board making sure all moves are legal. I wanted to avoid this, so I made a program to act as the moderator. You and your opponent can just pass the laptop back and forth. After you move, the screen will fade to blank. Pass the computer over, and when the other person has it, the screen will reveal only their pieces and not yours.
